# SQL_Pizza_Sales_Project

## In this project I have utilized SQL queries to solve the questions related to pizza sales. 
## This  project typically involves analyzing data related to pizza orders, customers choice, Revenue and possibly preferred order time within a pizza restaurant or chain. 
## The goal is to extract insights from the data using SQL queries to understand trends, customer preferences, popular items, sales performance. 
## This project could encompass tasks such as querying sales data to identify top-selling pizzas, calculating revenue by time period, and generating reports for management or marketing purposes. 
## Ultimately, the project aims to leverage SQL skills to drive business decisions and improve operational efficiency within the pizza sales domain.
